## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Click "Use this template" to create your own repository
2. Set up a Netlify site and configure Identity/Git Gateway
3. Update configuration files with your Netlify site URL
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
5. Access your blog and log in to the CMS

### Setting Up Decap CMS

Decap CMS allows you to manage your blog content through a web interface without editing files locally and pushing to GitHub. Here's how to set it up:

#### 1. Set Up Netlify Site and Authentication

While your blog content will be deployed on GitHub Pages, we need to use Netlify's authentication service for content management:

1. Sign up for a [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) account (free)
2. Click "New site from Git" and select your GitHub repository
3. Keep the deployment settings as default and click "Deploy site" (this is just for authentication, your actual blog will still be served through GitHub Pages)
4. Once deployed, note your Netlify site name (e.g., your-site-123456.netlify.app)
5. Go to site settings:
   - Navigate to **Site configuration** > **Identity** > click **Enable Identity**
   - Scroll down to **Registration** and set it to **Invite only** (recommended) or choose open registration
   - Go to **Services** > **Git Gateway** > click **Enable Git Gateway**

#### 2. Update Configuration Files with Your Netlify Site URL

In your forked repository, you need to modify the configuration in `public/admin/index.html`:

```javascript
// Define Netlify site URL - you only need to change this one place
const NETLIFY_SITE = "your-netlify-site-name.netlify.app";

// Pre-configure Netlify Identity API
window.netlifyIdentity = {
  api: {
    apiURL: `https://${NETLIFY_SITE}/.netlify/identity`
  }
};

// Also find and modify site URL configuration (around line 180)
site_url: "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name",
display_url: "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name",
```

Please replace the above URLs with your own GitHub Pages address, e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

> üí° **Important Note**: This template embeds all CMS configuration directly in the `index.html` file to ensure it works correctly in the GitHub Pages environment. If you need to modify content types or other CMS configuration, edit the `config` object in the `index.html` file (approximately lines 70-180).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration Tip:** This step is crucial! You must configure two types of URLs correctly:
1. Netlify Site URL - for authentication (e.g., `your-site-123456.netlify.app`)
2. GitHub Pages URL - for preview and site display (e.g., `your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`)

#### 3. Create Admin Account

After setting up the Identity service, you need to create an admin account:

1. In the Netlify dashboard, go to **Identity** > **Invite users**
2. Enter your email address and send the invitation
3. Check your email, accept the invitation, and set a password

#### 4. Access CMS Admin Interface

After completing the steps above and deploying your GitHub Pages website:

1. Visit your GitHub Pages site: `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`
2. Click the "Admin" link in the page footer
3. Click the "Login with Netlify Identity" button
4. Log in with your Netlify email and password
5. Once logged in, you can create and manage content through the friendly interface

### Customization

- **Content**: Manage through CMS or directly edit files in the `src/content` directory
- **Styles**: Modify `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/styles/globals.css`
- **Components**: Customize components in the `src/components` directory
- **Configuration**: Update site information in `src/content/config.json`

## üìù Using the CMS

With Decap CMS, you can easily manage your blog content:

1. Visit the "Admin" link in your site's footer to access the authentication page
2. Log in with your Netlify Identity account
3. Create and edit content through a friendly interface:
   - **Blog Posts**: Write new articles, set tags and featured images
   - **Pages**: Edit static pages like "About"
   - **Friend Links**: Manage friendship links
   - **Site Configuration**: Update basic site information

When you save changes, the CMS creates a commit and pushes it to your GitHub repository. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys the updated site.
